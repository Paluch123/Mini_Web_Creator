# Mini_Web_Creator

Welcome to my mini web creator!

Mini web creator is my personal project, which enables users to create customable websites without interference of the developer.

What you see below is overview and quick tutorial how to use application. 

Application was made with Pycharm IDE, in python django environment.

First you will have to create superuser and start development server, you can do it by opening project in your IDE and following these instructions: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/tutorial02/

After following these steps you can run dev server and log into your admin page where you can start creating your custom website.

At first what you will see is instruction at your home page, you can get rid of by it disabling instruction object in your admin page and adding your first section, which will replace home page.
